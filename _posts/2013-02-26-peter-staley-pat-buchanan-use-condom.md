Over the weekend I finally got around to watching *How to Survive a Plague* ([available on Netflix](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/How_to_Survive_a_Plague/70229270)), a wonderful documentary about the AIDS activism group ACT UP (the *AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power*). The film makes heavy use of archival footage from the ’80s and ’90s. One particular moment that I found illuminating was a clip from *Crossfire* featuring an exchange between [Peter Staley](https://twitter.com/peterstaley), a prominent ACT UP activist, and Pat Buchanan. The first half of the segment is [available on YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YwAoHdv4yQ), but I haven’t been able to find the full clip. However, you can see it in the film at the 30-minute mark. Here’s a transcript of the segment:

> <label>Tom Braden</label>: Peter Staley, you have the AIDS virus, and I am sorry. But, don’t you think that the Federal Drug Administration [*sic*] has a responsibility not to let people such as you have quacks that could cause even more harm than you already have?
>
> <label>Peter Staley</label>: The problem is, is that the FDA is using the same process to test a nasal spray as it is to test AIDS drugs. And it’s a 7-10 year process.
>
> <label>Braden</label>: You have the FDA giving you a drug. So far you’ve got AZT. Why would—
>
> <label>Staley</label>: Which I can’t take because it’s far too toxic, and over half the people that have HIV can’t take it.
>
> <label>Braden</label>: OK, but the FDA says there is nothing else that is worth anything.
>
> <label>Pat Buchanan</label>: Mr. Staley, this is gonna astonish you, but I agree with you a hundred percent. I think if someone’s got AIDS and someone wants to take a drug, it’s their life, and if it gives ’em hope, you oughta be able to take it. What I wanna ask you is whether you know of anything that you think might be some kind of miraculous cure that you think they’re sittin’ on at FDA.
>
> <label>Staley</label>: There are over one hundred and forty drugs out there that the FDA has identified as possibilities, and are in some stage of being looked at right now.
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: Why are they holding back—
>
> <label>Staley</label>: Among that one hundred and forty, there’s gotta be one or a combination thereof that can slow down this virus or halt it in its tracks.
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: You’re just simply carrying the virus, is that correct?
>
> <label>Staley</label>: I have a few very minor symptoms, and my immune system is virtually shot.
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: What would you like to take?
>
> <label>Staley</label>: I would like to be able to take dextran sulfate, legally. I’m taking it on the underground right now.
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: Well why not, Mr. Braden?
>
> <label>Braden</label>: Because for—I don’t know anything about dextran sulfate, and neither do you–
>
> <label>Staley</label>: Well I’ll tell you this: it’s an over-the-counter drug in Japan, and has been for twenty years.
>
> <label>Braden</label>: But—
>
> <label>Staley</label>: Over the counter.
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: Over the counter in Japan?
>
> <label>Staley</label>: Yes.
>
> <label>Braden</label>: But if the FDA says—
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: Mr. Staley–
>
> <label>Staley</label>: I’m only asking that they be released after there’s a minimal amount of efficacy, not a one hundred percent test.
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: Well, a final question to you. Let me get something here. You’ve got the pink triangle on your shirt.
>
> <label>Staley</label>: Yes.
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: I gather that means you’re a homosexual.
>
> <label>Staley</label>: Yes.
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: Lookin’ in the camera, what would you tell some kid—say you had a younger brother, twenty-one years old, who also might have homosexual tendencies—What would you tell him if you wanted him to live a long life?
>
> <label>Staley</label>: Use a condom. And also to use a lubricant by the way that has a medicine that can—
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: But aren’t you, this is Russian roulette.
>
> <label>Staley</label>: It is not Russian roulette. It is Russian roulette to not give people this information when human nature dictates that they’re gonna go out there and they’re gonna have sex.
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: You mean celibacy is impossible?
>
> <label>Staley</label>: It’s just not gonna work. People aren’t gonna do it and lots of people are gonna die. Now would you rather have a lot of people cheating under celibacy with thousands of people dying or would you rather save those lives and let them have sex?
>
> <label>Buchanan</label>: Well I think that uh, well. Thank you very much Peter Staley, thanks for being in our studio, Mr. Braden and I’ll be back in a minute.
