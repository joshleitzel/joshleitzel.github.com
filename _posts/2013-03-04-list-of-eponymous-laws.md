I was recently reminded of [Brooks’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)—that “adding manpower to a late software project makes it later”—and it led me to Wikipedia’s full [list of eponymous laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_eponymous_laws).

Besides the classic [Asimov robotics laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics) and [Clarke’s laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws), a few of my favorites:

> [Benford’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law): In any collection of statistics, a given statistic has roughly a 30% chance of starting with the digit 1.
>
> [Betteridge’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines): Any headline that ends in a question mark can be answered with a “no”.
>
> [Conway’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law): Organizations which design systems are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of the organization.
>
> [Gall’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%27s_law): A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.
>
> [Hofstadter’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstadter%27s_law): It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter’s Law.
>
> [Kerckhoff’s Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27_principle): A cryptosystem should be secure even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge.
>
> [Linus’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27_law): Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.
>
> [Mooers’s Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooers%27_law): An information retrieval system will tend not to be used whenever it is more painful and troublesome for a customer to have information than for him not to have it.
>
> [Niven’s Law of Time Travel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niven%27s_laws): If the universe of discourse permits the possibility of time travel and of changing the past, then no time machine will be invented in that universe.
>
> [Peter Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle): Employees tend to rise to their level of incompetence.

Now I’m off to inspect the even-longer Wikipedia [list of paradoxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_paradoxes).
