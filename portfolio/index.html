      <p>I wrote a set of Ruby scripts to scrape the late Aaron Swartz's blog and convert the contents into Markdown format. From the Markdown I used Pandoc to generate PDF, ePub, and Mobi files for each post; I also wrote a script to join all the posts together into one book-like file that's also available in all those formats.</p>

    <div class="details">
      <p>I joined Done as a "JavaScript intern" the summer before my senior year of college. We spent the first few months writing the service in Node.js before deciding it didn't suit our needs and re-writing everything in Rails. After college I became a full-time Software Engineer. We used Agile methods, TDD (RSpec, Capybara, Cucumber), MongoDB (Mongoid), and Heroku.</p>

      <p>I worked as a full-stack engineer at RedRover, contributing heavily to the two biggest components of the company: the back-end API, which was written in Rails and used to serve the webapp as well as the iOS apps; and the front-end webapp, which was written using Ember.js.</p>

    <div class="details">
      <p>Kronos is a side project of mine. It's a date/time library that aims to provide a natural syntax with extensible natural language support. It's written in CoffeeScript and was TDD'd using Mocha and Node.js. It's incredibly incomplete right now but has some convenient tidbits, such as a better timeout/interval syntax:</p>
      <blockquote><code>Kronos.in("5 seconds").do(-> alert "Could not reach server").unless(-> server.reached)</code></p></blockquote>

      <p>This was a project I did for a 'Large Data Sets' elective I took in college. It uses R to generate graphs of clusters and regressions from data sets, and then uses a Node.js server to display those graphs.</p>
